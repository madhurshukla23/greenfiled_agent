Whiteboard Session Notes - December 2025

Attendees: John Smith (CTO), Sarah Johnson (Security Lead), Mike Chen (Network Architect)

Key Discussion Points:

1. Network Architecture
   - Decided on hub-spoke topology for better isolation
   - Hub VNet will host shared services (firewall, VPN gateway, DNS)
   - Spoke VNets for production and development workloads
   - Consider Azure Virtual WAN for future multi-region expansion

2. Security Posture
   - Zero trust approach
   - No public endpoints for databases and storage
   - Private endpoints for all PaaS services
   - Network traffic must go through firewall for inspection
   - Consider Azure Bastion for VM access (no public IPs)

3. Identity and Access
   - Azure AD as primary identity provider
   - Federate with on-premises AD
   - Conditional access policies
   - Break-glass accounts for emergency access

4. Backup and DR
   - RPO: 4 hours
   - RTO: 8 hours for critical workloads
   - Azure Backup for VMs
   - Geo-redundant storage for critical data
   - Secondary region: US West 2

5. Cost Management
   - Budget alerts at 80% and 90% of monthly allocation
   - Reserved instances for predictable workloads
   - Auto-shutdown for dev/test VMs
   - Monthly cost reviews

Open Questions:
- Do we need ExpressRoute or is VPN sufficient? (Follow up with network team)
- What's the exact list of workloads for migration? (Waiting for app team)
- Disaster recovery region preference? (Check with business stakeholders)
