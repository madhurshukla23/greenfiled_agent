Azure Landing Zone Architecture - Sample Document

Overview:
This document provides an overview of Azure Landing Zone best practices and architecture patterns.

Key Components:

1. Management Groups
   - Tenant root group at the top of the hierarchy
   - Platform management group for shared services
   - Landing zones management group for application workloads
   - Sandbox management group for testing

2. Subscriptions
   - Management subscription for core infrastructure
   - Identity subscription for Active Directory services
   - Connectivity subscription for networking
   - Application subscriptions for workloads

3. Networking Architecture
   - Hub-VNet topology for centralized connectivity
   - Spoke VNets for isolated workloads
   - Virtual Network Gateway for VPN connectivity
   - Azure Firewall for security and traffic filtering
   - ExpressRoute for dedicated private connectivity

4. Security & Compliance
   - Azure Policy for governance and compliance
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for permissions
   - Azure Security Center for threat protection
   - Microsoft Defender for Cloud for security monitoring
   - Azure Key Vault for secrets management

5. Identity & Access Management
   - Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for identity
   - Conditional Access policies for secure access
   - Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for elevated access
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users

6. Monitoring & Operations
   - Azure Monitor for infrastructure monitoring
   - Log Analytics workspace for centralized logging
   - Application Insights for application performance
   - Azure Automation for operational tasks
   - Alerts and action groups for notifications

Best Practices:

- Use naming conventions consistently across all resources
- Implement tagging strategy for cost management and organization
- Enable diagnostic logs for all critical resources
- Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies
- Use Azure Blueprints for repeatable deployments
- Follow least privilege principle for access control
- Enable threat protection on all subscriptions
- Implement network segmentation and micro-segmentation
- Use private endpoints for PaaS services
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit

Common Questions:

Q: What is the recommended number of management groups?
A: Keep the hierarchy simple - typically 3-4 levels maximum. Avoid deep nesting as it can complicate policy inheritance.

Q: Should I use hub-spoke or Virtual WAN?
A: Hub-spoke is suitable for most scenarios. Use Virtual WAN for complex multi-region deployments with SD-WAN requirements.

Q: How do I manage costs in a landing zone?
A: Implement resource tagging, use Azure Cost Management, set budget alerts, and leverage Azure Advisor recommendations.

Q: What's the difference between sandbox and production landing zones?
A: Sandbox environments have relaxed policies for experimentation, while production landing zones enforce strict security and compliance controls.

Implementation Steps:

1. Design management group hierarchy
2. Create core subscriptions (Management, Identity, Connectivity)
3. Deploy hub networking infrastructure
4. Configure Azure Firewall and NSGs
5. Set up Azure Policy assignments
6. Implement RBAC and PIM
7. Configure monitoring and logging
8. Create application landing zones
9. Deploy sample workloads for testing
10. Document and train teams

Governance Framework:

- Policy-driven governance using Azure Policy
- Regular compliance audits and reviews
- Change management process for infrastructure updates
- Cost optimization reviews quarterly
- Security assessments and penetration testing
- Disaster recovery drills semi-annually

This is a foundational architecture that can be customized based on specific organizational requirements, compliance needs, and workload characteristics.
